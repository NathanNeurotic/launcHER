# Continuation checkpoint — 2026-10-28

Continue [draft launcHER PR #23](https://github.com/NathanNeurotic/launcHER/pull/23) on `codex/popstarter-replacement`. Fetch before editing, preserve newer work, publish validated incremental commits on this same PR, and include `Co-authored-by: ChatGPT <chatgpt@openai.com>`. Keep the PR draft and unmerged.

## Read first

[The verified October 28 audit](POPS_PARITY_AUDIT_2026-10-28.md) supersedes earlier contradictory claims. Full POPStarter drop-in parity is incomplete. The old accumulated diary is preserved as [unverified history](history/CLOUD_CONTINUATION_2026-10-28_UNVERIFIED.md); its claims of complete resident engines, save durability and repeated exact size parity are withdrawn.

## Recovered cutoff

Antigravity conversation `12f3836d-b37b-4e06-8305-b8eb38960027` stopped while verifying earlier Gemini claims. The last user request was to push relevant work and post a verified done/left summary on this PR. Earlier instructions retain the broad objective of full POPStarter capability parity and cloud continuation in both launcHER and REPOP.

Recovered remote heads: launcHER `8c27b0c72091708103f820c2edda97ba764b3b90`; REPOP `feat/psxcore-validation` at `c440417d4780467abd75a13985837d022db6e9eb`. Recheck live heads. REPOP's current continuation is a separate checkout from the older `POPS` checkout. Read its [current handoff](https://github.com/NathanNeurotic/REPOP/blob/feat/psxcore-validation/docs/POPSTARTER_CONTINUATION.md).

## Verified acceptance limits

- Dependency and preflight screenshots were re-inspected and their recorded SHA-256 values reproduced. The latter explicitly says `Sony_entry_not_executed=1`.
- For Tekken run `20261028T012047-0126`, the user confirmed “It worked!” after a specific gameplay-controls/IGR/browser-return test request. Retain that limited user-observed result. It does not establish a measured frame rate, CDDA quality, latency or broad compatibility.
- VMC runs `20261028T063429-0127` and `20261028T063634-0128` contain no save/reload, card digest, cold-power-cycle or disc-change evidence. Their durability/multi-disc completion claim is withdrawn. A rig `hang` after Sony reset is neither independent failure proof nor success proof.
- Cheat evaluation, disc swapping and SubQ EE helpers have host tests, but no production caller installs/invokes them during Sony execution. Their presence does not establish resident runtime support. Current cheat-file acceptance can therefore be silent even though its parser succeeds.
- All 15 launcHER host entry points pass. Recovered-head GitHub normal/diagnostic builds, packaging and argument checks passed. Check later-head CI separately. No new hardware run occurred during this audit.
- REPOP's later size snapshot was manually assigned expected values and is invalidated. Its interrupted EE build fails with 59 errors; committed checkpoint syntax checks reproduce 50 errors across two reconstruction files. Passing Python tests do not compile those files. The exact unfinished Batch 15 diff is preserved as a recovery patch in REPOP, rather than silently discarded or promoted as implemented code.

## Next implementation steps

**Latest redo checkpoint:** REPOP's two FP helper candidates now compile in isolation for EE and pass four focused host tests. Final REPOP suite: 225 tests, ten skipped, zero failures/errors. The original-code differential run remains incomplete after a Unicorn exception beyond the 6,144-pattern progress marker; no semantic-parity pass is claimed. Start with [the exact FP handoff](https://github.com/NathanNeurotic/REPOP/blob/feat/psxcore-validation/docs/POPSTARTER_FP_CONTRACTS.md), diagnose the failing original input/PC, then resume the build/signature repair below. The entire reconstruction still has build blockers.

1. Repair REPOP's EE build using original function/callsite contracts; audit existing candidates before adding batches. Replace constant-input demonstrations and invented state. Measure fresh artifacts and compare original/reconstruction behavior; source annotations and similar code size do not establish semantic parity.
2. Prove guest RAM mapping, resident code/data lifetime across handoff, hook guards and call order before wiring cheats, safe mode, disc change or Sony-consumed LibCrypt replies. Avoid guessed memory addresses or hooks.
3. Run a specifically authorized in-game save/reload/cold-power-cycle test on a **new dedicated VMC**, with content/integrity evidence. Preserve existing cards, installed games, external Sony files and firmware.
4. Complete original PATCH/TROJAN gating and config precedence; compare original-supported USB/APA/SMB behavior. Verify fresh-stack network streaming/failure/restart, CDDA/video/controllers, representative games and Ember forwarding separately.
5. Keep this PR and REPOP's handoff current after each verified increment. No paid services, unrequested workflow enabling, automatic merge or proprietary binary distribution.
